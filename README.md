Software engineer specializing in Ruby on Rails, security, and PKI systems. I build and maintain robust backend architectures, authentication systems, and certificate management workflows. My work combines deep domain expertise in TLS, cryptography, and automation with a strong focus on clean, maintainable code and practical security.

I actively contribute to open source, including projects like Authlogic, and develop tools and APIs that enhance reliability, scalability, and user trust. I’m also passionate about building secure SaaS products, exploring PQC, and improving developer experience through thoughtful system design.
